This is the coolstream branch of u-boot. It contains all parts to build
a working bootlaoder. This branch does not contain all the configurations
for other boards and enviroments.

==================

Coolstream Intl. Ltd. will not be responsible for broken Set-Top-Boxes
caused by your own work. If will not be able to restore your box into
operational mode if something fail while replacing the bootloader. If
your box is dead you have to give it to your dealer for repair, which
will cause service fees, so be carefull! Your work is on your own risk!


Notes about to build u-boot for Coolstream HDx Set-Top-Boxes:
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Make sure you have the ccross compiler installed properly on your system

- Configure the build process for HDx boards by calling:

  make coolstream_hdx_config

- Build u-boot by calling:

  make

  The resulting executable binary will be u-boot.bin. The build process
  also creates the mkimage tool in the tools directory, which is necessary
  to convert Linux kernel binaries into u-boot compatible binaries.
